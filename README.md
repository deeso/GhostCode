## About the Project

GhostCode isn't just a thrilling coding game; it's also powered by a robust Next.js project with an API for user registration, login, and updating account data. This section provides insight into the core of our project and how we parse your brilliant coding solutions using the Peg.js package.

### Next.js Project

Our GhostCode game is built on the Next.js framework, which offers an excellent foundation for creating web applications with React. Next.js enables us to provide you with a seamless and interactive gaming experience. The intuitive routing, server-side rendering, and excellent development experience of Next.js ensure that GhostCode runs smoothly.

### API for User Management

GhostCode comes equipped with a secure API for user management, making it easy for players to register, log in, and update their account data. Your data privacy and security are paramount to us, and we've implemented industry-standard practices to safeguard your information.

### Parsing User Code with Peg.js

One of the most exciting aspects of GhostCode is its ability to understand and execute your coding commands. We achieve this feat using the Peg.js package, a powerful parser generator for JavaScript. Peg.js allows us to transform your written code into actionable instructions for our spectral ghost character. It's the magic behind the scenes that brings your code to life within the game.

Our parser, powered by Peg.js, interprets your code and translates it into movements for the ghost. This allows you to control the ghost's actions and collect those elusive gems with precision. Peg.js enables us to create an immersive and responsive gaming experience that reacts to your coding decisions in real-time.

We hope you enjoy coding with GhostCode and exploring the eerie world of spectral syntax. If you have any questions, feedback, or ideas to enhance this project further, please feel free to share them. We're excited to have you as part of our cryptic coding community!
